    Hello, my name is Eduard Kotkas. This is my personal website, which I created out of interest for AngularJS.
    You can find many different things on here like my portfolio, blog, applications and some other experimental
    things that I'm working on. Have a look around and don't hesitate to contact me with any questions.
